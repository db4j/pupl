# PUPL - Paid Use Permissive License

Subject to the following restrictions, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive,
worldwide (subject to applicable laws) license to copy, modify, display,
use, create derivative works, and redistribute the Software. 

Restrictions:

- the copyright notice and the license notice must be retained in all copies or substantial portions of the Software

- if you use the software in production you must obtain a use-license or equivalent from the Licensor

- if a work that you distribute, that contains or is derived from the Software, is accompanied by the complete corresponding source code or an equivalent offer of such, each portion of both licensed to the recipient under either this license, at no additional per-use cost, or a license compatible with the GNU GPLv3, then use-license responsibilities may be left solely to the recipient, who may apply any use-license or equivalent (including those acquired at zero cost) to satisfy their use-license requirements;
otherwise, you must acquire on the recipient's behalf, or verify they possess, an applicable use-license

- you accept that you are entitled to no relief other than that described below if the Licensor is unable to or chooses not to issue use-licenses consistent with these terms


### Assurances
The Licensor agrees:

- to a fixed ($10 if unspecified) strike price
  - to publish per-annum and lifetime full prices, not to exceed 1 times and 10 times the strike price respectively, and to announce changes a month in advance
  - to disclose any known additional 3rd party claims on use of the software

- to issue use-licenses (per-annum and lifetime) purchasable without further restriction at full price (or, at your option, the respective strike prices) that will:
  - be transferable by informing the Licensor
  - be renewable (for per-annum, even with lapses) at that original price each year
  - without lapses, entitle purchase and renewal of 4 additional units at that original price (these units don't entitle additional unit rights, but otherwise act as full price units)
  - credit the greater of the current or the paid price of your purchased version towards upgrade to another version
  - permit the holder to use the Software for production on, at the holder's choice, either a single core (i.e., an independent actual processing unit) or the computational equivalent of a single core of a 2015 intel core i5 6600, for a period of 1 year (per-annum) or the term of the copyright (lifetime), starting at the time of purchase


- to allow all use-licenses purchased at non-zero-cost to be applied equally to use of either the original work or any derivative work, though derivative works may add additional restrictions

- to grant a perpetual zero-cost non-transferable waiver for production use on up to 10 cores (independent actual processing units) of software licensed under these terms; this waiver not to be combined by multiple executions of this agreement between the parties, whether for the same or other software

- that if you have made reasonable effort to comply with these terms and upon learning of a deviation from them rendered any payment that would have achieved compliance, you shall be considered to have complied; and that if actual usage is difficult to calculate an estimate may be used in lieu

- that if low duty cycle usage is spread over multiple cores and simultaneous usage is driven by coincidence, as opposed to by production necessity, then usage may be averaged over time

- that, in the event that the Licensor is unable to or fails to issue in a timely manner a use-license consistent with these terms at your request and attempted payment, you are granted non-transferable permission to use the Software while your attempt is ongoing; and, if you place full non-zero payment in escrow, all the rights you would have been entitled to had the use-licenses been issued

By exercising any of the permissions granted by this license, you signify your agreement to these terms.
Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice if you fail to comply with any terms of this license.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
